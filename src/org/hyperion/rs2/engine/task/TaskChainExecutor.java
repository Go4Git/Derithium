/**
 * A {@link TaskChainExecutor} holds a queue of {@link TaskChain}s that are ran
 * in <i>FIFO</i> order. When a task in the chain is fired the next task in the
 * chain waits for its specified delay then fires, and so on like a chain. This
 * continues until the end of the chain is reached and then the executor will
 * automatically shut down. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Chain executors can prove to be extremely useful when doing things that
 * require a lengthy amount of precisely executed tasks in a specific order.
 * This is because it only uses <b>one</b> task to run however many tasks it
 * needs to run, which means significantly less stress on the
 * {@link TaskManager}. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * An example of usage is provided below: <br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * 
 * If you had this factory executor and following tasks appended:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * FactoryExecutor executor = new FactoryExecutor(&quot;our-factory-executor&quot;, Time.SECONDS);
 * 
 * executor.append(new ChainTask() {
 *     ... // lets just say the delay was 3 and it printed &quot;Hello world!&quot;.
 * });
 * 
 * And
 * 
 * executor.append(new ChainTask() {
 *      ... // lets just say the delay was 5 and it printed &quot;Goodbye world!&quot;.
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If you ran the executor using <code>executor.run()</code> it would result in:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ... delay for three seconds
 * 
 * print &quot;Hello world!&quot;
 * 
 * ... delay for five seconds
 * 
 * print &quot;Goodbye world!&quot;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And the executor would shut down allowing for more tasks to be appended to
 * the internal queue and the chance to be ran again.
