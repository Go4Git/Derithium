# Ardorva

Ardorva is an RS2 server emultor based on the 464 protocol with OSRS content. Rather than focusing
on perfect emulation, Ardorva will focus on implementing popular and unique features
that don't require players to grind for endless hours.

## Introduction
Ardorva uses Maven to manage its dependencies. If you do not have Maven already 
installed, you can find it here: [Maven Homepage](https://maven.apache.org/). 
Once installed navigate to the directory and run:

`mvn install`
